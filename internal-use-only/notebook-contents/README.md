For easier editing, debugging, and copying/pasting while creating the [final Quantum Wordle Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pranavmarla/quantum-wordle/blob/main/quantum-wordle.ipynb), I created separate files to hold its various components/contents (i.e. its code, each separate Markdown block of text). Those files are contained in this folder.
