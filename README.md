# Quantum Wordle

Quantum Wordle is a fully functioning, playable quantum game that I created as my capstone project for Qubit by Qubitâ€™s 2022-2023 ["Introduction to Quantum Computing" course](https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/course-info). As the name implies, it is a quantum spin on the popular classical game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

The code consists of Python and Qiskit, and is contained in a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pranavmarla/quantum-wordle/blob/main/quantum-wordle.ipynb). To play this game, you will need to download the notebook and upload it to the [IBM Quantum Lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab) platform, where it can be executed.  
**Note:** Currently, GitHub's automatic preview of the notebook doesn't seem to display the formatting correctly. To see it formatted properly, either view it locally (on VS Code) or online (on IBM Quantum Lab).
